# bmp Module

## Overview

The `bmp` module provides measures to read/write image data in Microsoft BMP format.
To utilize it, import the `bmp` module using `import` function.

Below is an example to read a BMP file:

    import(bmp)
	img = image('foo.bmp')


## Exntension to Function's Capability

This module extends the capability of function `image()` and instance method `image#write()`
so that they can read/write BMP files.

When function `image()` is provided with a stream that satisfies the following conditions,
it would recognize the stream as a BMP file.

- The identifier of the stream ends with a suffix "`.bmp`".
- The stream data begins with a byte sequence "`BM`".

When instance method `image#write()` is provided with a stream that satisfies the following condition,
it would write image data in BMP format.

- The identifier of the stream ends with a suffix "`.bmp`".


## Extension to image Class

This module extends the `image` class with methods described here.
