GL_AMBIENT
params returns four integer or floating-point values representing the ambient intensity of the light source. Integer values, when requested, are linearly mapped from the internal floating-point representation such that 1.0 maps to the most positive representable integer value, and 
-1.0
 maps to the most negative representable integer value. If the internal value is outside the range 
-1
1
, the corresponding integer return value is undefined. The initial value is (0, 0, 0, 1).

GL_DIFFUSE
params returns four integer or floating-point values representing the diffuse intensity of the light source. Integer values, when requested, are linearly mapped from the internal floating-point representation such that 1.0 maps to the most positive representable integer value, and 
-1.0
 maps to the most negative representable integer value. If the internal value is outside the range 
-1
1
, the corresponding integer return value is undefined. The initial value for GL_LIGHT0 is (1, 1, 1, 1); for other lights, the initial value is (0, 0, 0, 0).

GL_SPECULAR
params returns four integer or floating-point values representing the specular intensity of the light source. Integer values, when requested, are linearly mapped from the internal floating-point representation such that 1.0 maps to the most positive representable integer value, and 
-1.0
 maps to the most negative representable integer value. If the internal value is outside the range 
-1
1
, the corresponding integer return value is undefined. The initial value for GL_LIGHT0 is (1, 1, 1, 1); for other lights, the initial value is (0, 0, 0, 0).

GL_POSITION
params returns four integer or floating-point values representing the position of the light source. Integer values, when requested, are computed by rounding the internal floating-point values to the nearest integer value. The returned values are those maintained in eye coordinates. They will not be equal to the values specified using glLight, unless the modelview matrix was identity at the time glLight was called. The initial value is (0, 0, 1, 0).

GL_SPOT_DIRECTION
params returns three integer or floating-point values representing the direction of the light source. Integer values, when requested, are computed by rounding the internal floating-point values to the nearest integer value. The returned values are those maintained in eye coordinates. They will not be equal to the values specified using glLight, unless the modelview matrix was identity at the time glLight was called. Although spot direction is normalized before being used in the lighting equation, the returned values are the transformed versions of the specified values prior to normalization. The initial value is 
0
0
-1
.

GL_SPOT_EXPONENT
params returns a single integer or floating-point value representing the spot exponent of the light. An integer value, when requested, is computed by rounding the internal floating-point representation to the nearest integer. The initial value is 0.

GL_SPOT_CUTOFF
params returns a single integer or floating-point value representing the spot cutoff angle of the light. An integer value, when requested, is computed by rounding the internal floating-point representation to the nearest integer. The initial value is 180.

GL_CONSTANT_ATTENUATION
params returns a single integer or floating-point value representing the constant (not distance-related) attenuation of the light. An integer value, when requested, is computed by rounding the internal floating-point representation to the nearest integer. The initial value is 1.

GL_LINEAR_ATTENUATION
params returns a single integer or floating-point value representing the linear attenuation of the light. An integer value, when requested, is computed by rounding the internal floating-point representation to the nearest integer. The initial value is 0.

GL_QUADRATIC_ATTENUATION
params returns a single integer or floating-point value representing the quadratic attenuation of the light. An integer value, when requested, is computed by rounding the internal floating-point representation to the nearest integer. The initial value is 0.
