\section{\class{wxFocusEvent}}\label{wxfocusevent}

A focus event is sent when a window's focus changes. The window losing focus
receives a ``kill focus'' event while the window gaining it gets a ``set
focus'' one.

Notice that the set focus event happens both when the user gives focus to the
window (whether using the mouse or keyboard) and when it is done from the
program itself using \helpref{SetFocus}{wxwindowsetfocus}.

To process a focus event, use these event handler macros to direct input to a member
function that takes a wxFocusEvent argument.

Constructor.


\membersection{wxFocusEvent::GetWindow}\label{wxfocuseventgetwindow}

Returns the window associated with this event, that is the window which had the
focus before for the \texttt{wxEVT\_SET\_FOCUS} event and the window which is
going to receive focus for the \texttt{wxEVT\_KILL\_FOCUS} one.

Warning: the window pointer may be \texttt{NULL}!
