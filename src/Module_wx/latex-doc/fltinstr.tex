\section{\class{wxFilterInputStream}}\label{wxfilterinputstream}

A filter stream has the capability of a normal stream but it can be placed on top
of another stream. So, for example, it can uncompress or decrypt the data which are read
from another stream and pass it to the requester.

\func{}{wxFilterInputStream}{\param{wxInputStream\&}{ stream}}

takes ownership of it. If it is passed by reference then it does not.
