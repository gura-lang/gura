\section{wxGTK port}\label{wxgtkport}

wxGTK is a port of wxWidgets using the GTK+ library.
It makes use of GTK+'s native widgets wherever possible and uses
wxWidgets' generic controls when needed. GTK+ itself has been
ported to a number of systems, but so far only the original X11
version is supported. Support for other GTK+ backends is planned,
such as the new DirectFB backend.

All work is being done on GTK+ version 2.0 and above. Support for
GTK+ 1.2 will be deprecated in a later release.

You will need GTK+ 2.0 or higher which is available from:

\urlref{http://www.gtk.org}{http://www.gtk.org}

The newer version of GTK+ you use, the more native widgets and
features will be utilized. We have gone to a great extent to
allow compiling wxWidgets applications with a latest version of
GTK+, with the resulting binary working on systems even with a
much lower version of GTK+. You will have to ensure that the
application is launched with lazy symbol binding for that.

In order to configure wxWidgets to compile wxGTK you will 
need use the {\tt --with-gtk} argument to the {\tt configure} script.
This is the default for many systems.

GTK+ 1.2 can still be used, albeit discouraged. For that you can
pass {\tt --with-gtk=1} to the {\tt configure} script.

For further information, please see the files in docs/gtk
in the distribution.
