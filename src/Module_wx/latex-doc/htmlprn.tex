\subsection{HTML Printing}\label{printing}

The wxHTML library provides printing facilities with several levels of complexity. 

The easiest way to print an HTML document is to use 
\helpref{wxHtmlEasyPrinting class}{wxhtmleasyprinting}. It lets you print HTML documents with only one
command and you don't have to worry about deriving from the wxPrintout class at all. It is only a simple wrapper around the 
\helpref{wxHtmlPrintout}{wxhtmlprintout}, normal wxWidgets printout class.

And finally there is the low level class \helpref{wxHtmlDCRenderer}{wxhtmldcrenderer} which you can use to
render HTML into a rectangular area on any DC. It supports rendering into multiple rectangles with the same
width. (The most common use of this is placing one rectangle on each page or printing into two columns.)
