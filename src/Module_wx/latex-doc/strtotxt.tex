\section{\class{wxStreamToTextRedirector}}\label{wxstreamtotextredirector}

This class can be used to (temporarily) redirect all output sent to a C++
ostream object to a \helpref{wxTextCtrl}{wxtextctrl} instead.

{\bf NB:} Some compilers and/or build configurations don't support multiply
inheriting \helpref{wxTextCtrl}{wxtextctrl} from {\tt std::streambuf} in which
case this class is not compiled in. You also must have {\tt wxUSE\_STD\_IOSTREAM} 
option on (i.e. set to $1$) in your setup.h to be able to use it. Under Unix,
specify {\tt --enable-std\_iostreams} switch when running configure for this.

Example of usage:
{\small%
\begin{verbatim}
  using namespace std;

  wxTextCtrl *text = new wxTextCtrl(...);

  {
    wxStreamToTextRedirector redirect(text);

    // this goes to the text control
    cout << "Hello, text!" << endl;
  }

  // this goes somewhere else, presumably to stdout
  cout << "Hello, console!" << endl;
\end{verbatim}
}%

\membersection{wxStreamToTextRedirector::wxStreamToTextRedirector}\label{wxstreamtotextredirectorctor}

\func{}{wxStreamToTextRedirector}{\param{wxTextCtrl }{*text}, \param{ostream *}{ostr = NULL}}

The constructor starts redirecting output sent to {\it ostr} or {\it cout} for
the default parameter value to the text control {\it text}.

\wxheading{Parameters}

\docparam{text}{The text control to append output too, must be non-NULL}

\docparam{ostr}{The C++ stream to redirect, {\it cout} is used if it is NULL}

\membersection{wxStreamToTextRedirector::\destruct{wxStreamToTextRedirector}}\label{wxstreamtotextredirectordtor}

\func{}{\destruct{wxStreamToTextRedirector}}{\void}

When a wxStreamToTextRedirector object is destroyed, the redirection is ended
and any output sent to the C++ ostream which had been specified at the time of
the object construction will go to its original destination.
