\section{Standard event identifiers}\label{stdevtid}

wxWidgets defines a special identifier value {\tt wxID\_ANY} which is used in
the following two situations:

\begin{itemize}
\item when creating a new window you may specify {\tt wxID\_ANY} to let
wxWidgets assign an unused identifier to it automatically
\item when installing an event handler using either the event table
macros or \helpref{wxEvtHandler::Connect}{wxevthandlerconnect},
you may use it to indicate that you want to handle the events
coming from any control, regardless of its identifier
\end{itemize}

Another standard special identifier value is {\tt wxID\_NONE}: this is a value
which is not matched by any other id.

wxWidgets also defines a few standard command identifiers which may be used by
the user code and also are sometimes used by wxWidgets itself. These reserved
identifiers are all in the range between {\tt wxID\_LOWEST} and 
{\tt wxID\_HIGHEST} and, accordingly, the user code should avoid defining its
own constants in this range.
