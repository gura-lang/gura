\section{\class{wxTreeItemData}}\label{wxtreeitemdata}

wxTreeItemData is some (arbitrary) user class associated with some item. The
main advantage of having this class is that wxTreeItemData objects are
destroyed automatically by the tree and, as this class has virtual destructor,
it means that the memory and any other resources associated with a tree item
will be automatically freed when it is deleted. Note that we don't use wxObject
as the base class for wxTreeItemData because the size of this class is
critical: in many applications, each tree leaf will have wxTreeItemData
associated with it and the number of leaves may be quite big.

Also please note that because the objects of this class are deleted by the tree
using the operator {\tt delete}, they must always be allocated on the heap
using {\tt new}.

\membersection{wxTreeItemData::wxTreeItemData}\label{wxtreeitemdatactor}

\func{}{wxTreeItemData}{\void}

Default constructor.

\pythonnote{The wxPython version of this constructor optionally
accepts any Python object as a parameter.  This object is then
associated with the tree item using the wxTreeItemData as a
container.

In addition, the following methods are added in wxPython for accessing
the object:

\indented{2cm}{\begin{twocollist}\itemsep=0pt
\twocolitem{{\bf GetData()}}{Returns a reference to the Python Object}
\twocolitem{{\bf SetData(obj)}}{Associates a new Python Object with the
wxTreeItemData}
\end{twocollist}}
}

\perlnote{In wxPerl the constructor accepts as parameter an optional scalar,
 and stores it as client data. You may retrieve this data by calling
 {\bf GetData()}, and set it by calling {\bf SetData( data ).}
}

\membersection{wxTreeItemData::\destruct{wxTreeItemData}}\label{wxtreeitemdatadtor}

\func{void}{\destruct{wxTreeItemData}}{\void}

Virtual destructor.

\membersection{wxTreeItemData::GetId}\label{wxtreeitemdatagetid}

\func{const wxTreeItemId\&}{GetId}{\void}

Returns the item associated with this node.

\membersection{wxTreeItemData::SetId}\label{wxtreeitemdatasetid}

\func{void}{SetId}{\param{const wxTreeItemId\&}{ id}}

Sets the item associated with this node.
