A wxGraphicsPen is a native representation of a pen. It is used for stroking a path on a graphics context. The contents are specific and private to the respective renderer. Instances are ref counted and can therefore be assigned as usual. The only way to get a valid instance is via a CreatePen call on the graphics context or the renderer instance.
