\section{\class{wxMenuEvent}}\label{wxmenuevent}

This class is used for a variety of menu-related events. Note that
these do not include menu command events, which are
handled using \helpref{wxCommandEvent}{wxcommandevent} objects.

The default handler for wxEVT\_MENU\_HIGHLIGHT displays help
text in the first field of the status bar.

\wxheading{Event table macros}

To process a menu event, use these event handler macros to direct input to member
functions that take a wxMenuEvent argument. They can only be processed by
a menubar's frame.
