\section{\class{wxSplitterEvent}}\label{wxsplitterevent}

This class represents the events generated by a splitter control. Also there is
only one event class, the data associated to the different events is not the
same and so not all accessor functions may be called for each event. The
documentation mentions the kind of event(s) for which the given accessor
function makes sense: calling it for other types of events will result
in assert failure (in debug mode) and will return meaningless results.

\wxheading{Event table macros}

To process a splitter event, use these event handler macros to direct input to member
functions that take a wxSplitterEvent argument.

\twocolwidtha{10cm}
\begin{twocollist}\itemsep=0pt
\twocolitem{{\bf EVT\_SPLITTER\_SASH\_POS\_CHANGING(id, func)}}{The sash
position is in the process of being changed. You may prevent this change
from happening by calling \helpref{Veto}{wxnotifyeventveto} or you may also
modify the position of the tracking bar to properly reflect the position that
would be set if the drag were to be completed at this point. Processes a
wxEVT\_COMMAND\_SPLITTER\_SASH\_POS\_CHANGING event.}
\twocolitem{{\bf EVT\_SPLITTER\_SASH\_POS\_CHANGED(id, func)}}{The sash
position was changed. This event is generated after the user releases the mouse
after dragging the splitter.
Processes a wxEVT\_COMMAND\_SPLITTER\_SASH\_POS\_CHANGED event.}
\twocolitem{{\bf EVT\_SPLITTER\_UNSPLIT(id, func)}}{The splitter has been just
unsplit. Processes a wxEVT\_COMMAND\_SPLITTER\_UNSPLIT event. This event can't
be vetoed.}
\twocolitem{{\bf EVT\_SPLITTER\_DCLICK(id, func)}}{The sash was double
clicked. The default behaviour is to unsplit the window when this happens
(unless the minimum pane size has been set to a value greater than zero). This
won't happen if you veto this event. Processes a
wxEVT\_COMMAND\_SPLITTER\_DOUBLECLICKED event.}

\membersection{wxSplitterEvent::wxSplitterEvent}\label{wxsplittereventconstr}

\func{}{wxSplitterEvent}{\param{wxEventType}{ eventType = wxEVT\_NULL},
                         \param{wxSplitterWindow *}{ splitter = NULL}}

Constructor. Used internally by wxWidgets only.


\membersection{wxSplitterEvent::GetSashPosition}\label{wxsplittereventgetsashposition}

\constfunc{int}{GetSashPosition}{\void}

Returns the new sash position.

May only be called while processing
wxEVT\_COMMAND\_SPLITTER\_SASH\_POS\_CHANGING and
wxEVT\_COMMAND\_SPLITTER\_SASH\_POS\_CHANGED events.


\membersection{wxSplitterEvent::GetX}\label{wxsplittereventgetx}

\constfunc{int}{GetX}{\void}

Returns the x coordinate of the double-click point.

May only be called while processing
wxEVT\_COMMAND\_SPLITTER\_DOUBLECLICKED events.


\membersection{wxSplitterEvent::GetY}\label{wxsplittereventgety}

\constfunc{int}{GetY}{\void}

Returns the y coordinate of the double-click point.

May only be called while processing
wxEVT\_COMMAND\_SPLITTER\_DOUBLECLICKED events.

\membersection{wxSplitterEvent::GetWindowBeingRemoved}\label{wxsplittereventgetwindowbeingremoved}

\constfunc{wxWindow*}{GetWindowBeingRemoved}{\void}

Returns a pointer to the window being removed when a splitter window
is unsplit.

May only be called while processing
wxEVT\_COMMAND\_SPLITTER\_UNSPLIT events.


\membersection{wxSplitterEvent::SetSashPosition}\label{wxsplittereventsetsashposition}

\func{void}{SetSashPosition}{\param{int}{ pos}}

In the case of wxEVT\_COMMAND\_SPLITTER\_SASH\_POS\_CHANGED events,
sets the new sash position. In the case of
wxEVT\_COMMAND\_SPLITTER\_SASH\_POS\_CHANGING events, sets the new
tracking bar position so visual feedback during dragging will
represent that change that will actually take place. Set to -1 from
the event handler code to prevent repositioning.

May only be called while processing
wxEVT\_COMMAND\_SPLITTER\_SASH\_POS\_CHANGING and
wxEVT\_COMMAND\_SPLITTER\_SASH\_POS\_CHANGED events.

\wxheading{Parameters}

\docparam{pos}{New sash position.}
