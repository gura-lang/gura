\subsection{Input Filters}\label{filters}

The wxHTML library provides a mechanism for reading and displaying
files of many different file formats. 

\helpref{wxHtmlWindow::LoadPage}{wxhtmlwindowloadpage} can load not
only HTML files but any known file. To make a file type known to wxHtmlWindow
you must create a \helpref{wxHtmlFilter}{wxhtmlfilter} filter and
register it using \helpref{wxHtmlWindow::AddFilter}{wxhtmlwindowaddfilter}.
