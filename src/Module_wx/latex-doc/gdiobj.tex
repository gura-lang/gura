\section{\class{wxGDIObject}}\label{wxgdiobject}

This class allows platforms to implement functionality to optimise GDI objects, such
as wxPen, wxBrush and wxFont. On Windows, the underling GDI objects are a scarce resource
and are cleaned up when a usage count goes to zero. On some platforms this
class may not have any special functionality.

Since the functionality of this class is platform-specific, it is not documented here in detail.
