\section{\class{wxWindowDC}}\label{wxwindowdc}

A wxWindowDC must be constructed if an application wishes to paint on the
whole area of a window (client and decorations).
This should normally be constructed as a temporary stack object; don't store
a wxWindowDC object.

To draw on a window from inside {\bf OnPaint}, construct a \helpref{wxPaintDC}{wxpaintdc} object.

To draw on the client area of a window from outside {\bf OnPaint}, construct a \helpref{wxClientDC}{wxclientdc} object.

To draw on the whole window including decorations, construct a \helpref{wxWindowDC}{wxwindowdc} object
(Windows only).
