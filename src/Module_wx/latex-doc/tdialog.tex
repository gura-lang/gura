Classes: \helpref{wxDialog}{wxdialog}

A dialog box is similar to a panel, in that it is a window which can
be used for placing controls, with the following exceptions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A surrounding frame is implicitly created.
\item Extra functionality is automatically given to the dialog box,
  such as tabbing between items (currently Windows only).
\item If the dialog box is {\it modal}, the calling program is blocked
  until the dialog box is dismissed.
\end{enumerate}

Under Windows 3, modal dialogs have to be emulated using
modeless dialogs and a message loop. This is because Windows 3 expects
the contents of a modal dialog to be loaded from a resource file or
created on receipt of a dialog initialization message. This is too
restrictive for wxWidgets, where any window may be created and displayed
before its contents are created.

For a set of dialog convenience functions, including file selection, see
\rtfsp\helpref{Dialog functions}{dialogfunctions}.

See also \helpref{wxPanel}{wxpanel} and \helpref{wxWindow}{wxwindow} for inherited
member functions. Validation of data in controls is covered
in \helpref{Validator overview}{validatoroverview}.
