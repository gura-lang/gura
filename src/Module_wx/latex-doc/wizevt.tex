\section{\class{wxWizardEvent}}\label{wxwizardevent}

wxWizardEvent class represents an event generated by the
\helpref{wizard}{wxwizard}: this event is first sent to the page itself and,
if not processed there, goes up the window hierarchy as usual.

\wxheading{Derived from}

\helpref{wxNotifyEvent}{wxnotifyevent}\\
\helpref{wxCommandEvent}{wxcommandevent}\\
\helpref{wxEvent}{wxevent}\\

\membersection{wxWizardEvent::wxWizardEvent}\label{wxwizardeventwxwizardevent}

\func{}{wxWizardEvent}{\param{wxEventType }{type = wxEVT\_NULL}, \param{int }{id = -1}, \param{bool }{direction = true}}

Constructor. It is not normally used by the user code as the objects of this
type are constructed by wxWizard.

\membersection{wxWizardEvent::GetDirection}\label{wxwizardeventgetdirection}

\constfunc{bool}{GetDirection}{\void}

Return the direction in which the page is changing: for {\tt
EVT\_WIZARD\_PAGE\_CHANGING}, return {\tt true} if we're going forward or
false otherwise and for {\tt EVT\_WIZARD\_PAGE\_CHANGED} return {\tt true} if
we came from the previous page and {\tt false} if we returned from the next
one.

\membersection{wxWizardEvent::GetPage}\label{wxwizardeventgetpage}

\constfunc{wxWizardPage*}{GetPage}{\void}

Returns the \helpref{wxWizardPage}{wxwizardpage} which was active when this
event was generated.
