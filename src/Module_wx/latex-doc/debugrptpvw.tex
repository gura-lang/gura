\section{\class{wxDebugReportPreview}}\label{wxdebugreportpreview}

This class presents the debug report to the user and allows him to veto report
entirely or remove some parts of it. Although not mandatory, using this class
is strongly recommended as data included in the debug report might contain
sensitive private information and the user should be notified about it as well
as having a possibility to examine the data which had been gathered to check
whether this is effectively the case and discard the debug report if it is.

wxDebugReportPreview is an abstract base class, currently the only concrete
class deriving from it is 
\helpref{wxDebugReportPreviewStd}{wxdebugreportpreviewstd}.

\wxheading{Derived from}

No base class

\wxheading{Include files}

\membersection{wxDebugReportPreview::wxDebugReportPreview}\label{wxdebugreportpreviewwxdebugreportpreview}

\func{}{wxDebugReportPreview}{\void}

Trivial default constructor.


\membersection{wxDebugReportPreview::\destruct{wxDebugReportPreview}}\label{wxdebugreportpreviewdtor}

\func{}{\destruct{wxDebugReportPreview}}{\void}

dtor is trivial as well but should be virtual for a base class


\membersection{wxDebugReportPreview::Show}\label{wxdebugreportpreviewshow}

\constfunc{bool}{Show}{\param{wxDebugReport\& }{dbgrpt}}

Present the report to the user and allow him to modify it by removing some or
all of the files and, potentially, adding some notes. Return \true if the
report should be processed or \false if the user chose to cancel report
generation or removed all files from it.
