\section{\class{wxNotebookEvent}}\label{wxnotebookevent}

This class represents the events generated by a notebook control: currently,
there are two of them. The PAGE\_CHANGING event is sent before the current
page is changed. It allows the program to examine the current page (which
can be retrieved with 
\helpref{GetOldSelection()}{wxnotebookeventgetoldselection}) and to veto the page
change by calling \helpref{Veto()}{wxnotifyeventveto} if, for example, the
current values in the controls of the old page are invalid.

The second event - PAGE\_CHANGED - is sent after the page has been changed and
the program cannot veto it any more, it just informs it about the page change.

To summarize, if the program is interested in validating the page values
before allowing the user to change it, it should process the PAGE\_CHANGING
event, otherwise PAGE\_CHANGED is probably enough. In any case, it is probably
unnecessary to process both events at once.

\membersection{wxNotebookEvent::wxNotebookEvent}\label{wxnotebookeventconstr}

\func{}{wxNotebookEvent}{\param{wxEventType}{ eventType = wxEVT\_NULL},
 \param{int}{ id = 0}, \param{int}{ sel = $-1$}, \param{int}{ oldSel = $-1$}}

Constructor (used internally by wxWidgets only).


\membersection{wxNotebookEvent::GetOldSelection}\label{wxnotebookeventgetoldselection}

\constfunc{int}{GetOldSelection}{\void}

Returns the page that was selected before the change, $-1$ if none was selected.


\membersection{wxNotebookEvent::GetSelection}\label{wxnotebookeventgetselection}

\constfunc{int}{GetSelection}{\void}

Returns the currently selected page, or $-1$ if none was selected.

{\bf NB:} under Windows, GetSelection() will return the same value as\rtfsp
\helpref{GetOldSelection()}{wxnotebookeventgetoldselection} when called from
{\tt EVT\_NOTEBOOK\_PAGE\_CHANGING} handler and not the page which is going to
be selected. Also note that the values of selection and old selection returned
for an event generated in response to a call to 
\helpref{wxNotebook::SetSelection}{wxnotebooksetselection} shouldn't be trusted
as they are currently inconsistent under different platforms (but in this case
you presumably don't need them anyhow as you already have the corresponding
information).


\membersection{wxNotebookEvent::SetOldSelection}\label{wxnotebookeventsetoldselection}

\func{void}{SetOldSelection}{\param{int}{ page}}

Sets the id of the page selected before the change.


\membersection{wxNotebookEvent::SetSelection}\label{wxnotebookeventsetselection}

\func{void}{SetSelection}{\param{int}{ page}}

Sets the selection member variable.
