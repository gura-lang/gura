\section{\class{wxMutexLocker}}\label{wxmutexlocker}

This is a small helper class to be used with \helpref{wxMutex}{wxmutex} 
objects. A wxMutexLocker acquires a mutex lock in the constructor and releases
(or unlocks) the mutex in the destructor making it much more difficult to
forget to release a mutex (which, in general, will promptly lead to serious
problems). See \helpref{wxMutex}{wxmutex} for an example of wxMutexLocker
usage.

\membersection{wxMutexLocker::wxMutexLocker}\label{wxmutexlockerctor}

\func{}{wxMutexLocker}{\param{wxMutex\&}{ mutex}}

Constructs a wxMutexLocker object associated with mutex and locks it.
Call \helpref{IsOk}{wxmutexlockerisok} to check if the mutex was
successfully locked.

\membersection{wxMutexLocker::\destruct{wxMutexLocker}}\label{wxmutexlockerdtor}

\func{}{\destruct{wxMutexLocker}}{\void}

Destructor releases the mutex if it was successfully acquired in the ctor.

\membersection{wxMutexLocker::IsOk}\label{wxmutexlockerisok}

\constfunc{bool}{IsOk}{\void}

Returns true if mutex was acquired in the constructor, false otherwise.
