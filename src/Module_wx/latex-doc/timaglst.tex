Classes: \helpref{wxImageList}{wximagelist}

An image list is a list of images that may have transparent areas.
The class helps an application organise a collection of images
so that they can be referenced by integer index instead of by
pointer.

Image lists are used in \helpref{wxNotebook}{wxnotebook}, 
\helpref{wxListCtrl}{wxlistctrl}, \helpref{wxTreeCtrl}{wxlistctrl} and
some other control classes.
