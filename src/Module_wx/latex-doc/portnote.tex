wxWidgets defines a common API across platforms, but uses the native graphical
user interface (GUI) on each platform, so your program will take on the native
look and feel that users are familiar with. Unfortunately native toolkits and
hardware do not always support the functionality that the wxWidgets API
requires. This chapter collects notes about differences among supported platforms and ports.
