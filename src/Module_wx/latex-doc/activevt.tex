or deactivated.

\wxheading{Event table macros}

To process an activate event, use these event handler macros to direct input to a member
function that takes a wxActivateEvent argument.

\twocolwidtha{7cm}
\begin{twocollist}\itemsep=0pt
\twocolitem{{\bf EVT\_ACTIVATE(func)}}{Process a wxEVT\_ACTIVATE event.}
\twocolitem{{\bf EVT\_ACTIVATE\_APP(func)}}{Process a wxEVT\_ACTIVATE\_APP event.}
\twocolitem{{\bf EVT\_HIBERNATE(func)}}{Process a hibernate event, supplying the member function.
This event applies to wxApp only, and only on Windows SmartPhone and PocketPC. It is generated when the
system is low on memory; the application should free up as much memory as possible, and restore
full working state when it receives a wxEVT\_ACTIVATE or wxEVT\_ACTIVATE\_APP event.}
\end{twocollist}%

\wxheading{Remarks}

A top-level window (a dialog or frame) receives an activate event when it is
being activated or deactivated. This is indicated visually by the title
bar changing colour, and a subwindow gaining the keyboard focus.

An application is activated or deactivated when one of its frames becomes activated,
or a frame becomes inactivated resulting in all application frames being inactive.

Please note that usually you should call \helpref{event.Skip()}{wxeventskip} in
your handlers for these events as not doing so can result in strange effects.
