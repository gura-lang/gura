\section{\class{wxCriticalSection}}\label{wxcriticalsection}

A critical section object is used for exactly the same purpose as 
\helpref{mutexes}{wxmutex}. The only difference is that under Windows platform
critical sections are only visible inside one process, while mutexes may be
shared between processes, so using critical sections is slightly more
efficient. The terminology is also slightly different: mutex may be locked (or
acquired) and unlocked (or released) while critical section is entered and left
by the program.

Finally, you should try to use 
\helpref{wxCriticalSectionLocker}{wxcriticalsectionlocker} class whenever
possible instead of directly using wxCriticalSection for the same reasons 
\helpref{wxMutexLocker}{wxmutexlocker} is preferrable to 
\helpref{wxMutex}{wxmutex} - please see wxMutex for an example.

\membersection{wxCriticalSection::wxCriticalSection}\label{wxcriticalsectionctor}

\func{}{wxCriticalSection}{\void}

Default constructor initializes critical section object.

\membersection{wxCriticalSection::\destruct{wxCriticalSection}}\label{wxcriticalsectiondtor}

\func{}{\destruct{wxCriticalSection}}{\void}

Destructor frees the resources.

\membersection{wxCriticalSection::Enter}\label{wxcriticalsectionenter}

\func{void }{Enter}{\void}

Enter the critical section (same as locking a mutex). There is no error return
for this function. After entering the critical section protecting some global
data the thread running in critical section may safely use/modify it.

\membersection{wxCriticalSection::Leave}\label{wxcriticalsectionleave}

\func{void }{Leave}{\void}

Leave the critical section allowing other threads use the global data protected
by it. There is no error return for this function.
