\section{wxX11 port}\label{wxx11port}

wxX11 is a port of wxWidgets using X11 (The X Window System)
as the underlying graphics backend. wxX11 draws its widgets
using the wxUniversal widget set which is now part of wxWidgets.
wxX11 is well-suited for a number of special applications such
as those running on systems with few resources (PDAs) or for
applications which need to use a special themed look. You will need
wxWidgets 2.3.2 or higher.

In order to configure wxWidgets to compile wxX11 you will 
need to type:

\begin{verbatim}
configure --with-x11 --with-universal
\end{verbatim}

For further information, please see the files in docs/x11
in the distribution. There is also a page on the use of
wxWidgets for embedded applications on the wxWidgets web site.
