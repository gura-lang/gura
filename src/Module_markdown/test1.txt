The flags parameter specifies what part(s) of SDL to initialize.

Check if Visual Studio 2010 has been installed. You can use Express version as well.
Run a batch file gura\src\setup-gura-guest.bat, which downloads necessary packages
from Git repository (https://github.com/ypsitau/gura-guest.git) and build them.

The batch file may occur an error that says it cannot find vcvarsall.bat.
In such a case, you have to edit gura\gura-guest\setup.bat
and modify VCVARSALL variable so that it points to a right directory of Visual Studio.
