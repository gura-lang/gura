1. Check if Visual Studio 2010 has been installed. You can use Express version as well.
2. Run a batch file gura\src\setup-gura-guest.bat, which downloads necessary packages
   from Git repository (https://github.com/ypsitau/gura-guest.git) and build them.
   The batch file may occur an error that says it cannot find vcvarsall.bat.
   In such a case, you have to edit gura\gura-guest\setup.bat
   and modify VCVARSALL variable so that it points to a right directory of Visual Studio.
3. Open gura\src\gura.sln with Visual Studio 2010, switch the configuration to Release
   and build it.
