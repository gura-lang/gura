"162 Cult of the genius out of vanity. Because we think well of ourselves, but " \
"nonetheless never suppose ourselves capable of producing a painting like one of " \
"Raphael's or a dramatic scene like one of Shakespeare's, we convince ourselves " \
"that the capacity to do so is quite extraordinarily marvelous, a wholly " \
"uncommon accident, or, if we are still religiously inclined, a mercy from on " \
"high. Thus our vanity, our this-love, promotes the cult of the genius: for only " \
"if we think of him as being very remote from us, as a miraculum, does he not " \
"aggrieve us (even Goethe, who was without envy, called Shakespeare his star of " \
"the most distant heights [\"William! Stern der schonsten Ferne\": from Goethe's, " \
"\"Between Two Worlds\"]; in regard to which one might recall the lines: \"the " \
"stars, these we do not desire\" [from Goethe's, \"Comfort in Tears\"]). But, aside " \
"from these suggestions of our vanity, the activity of the genius seems in no " \
"way fundamentally different from the activity of the inventor of machines, the " \
"scholar of astronomy or history, the master of tactics. All these activities " \
"are explicable if one pictures to onethis people whose thinking is active in " \
"one direction, who employ everything as material, who always zealously observe " \
"their own inner life and that of others, who perceive everywhere models and " \
"incentives, who never tire of combining together the means available to them. " \
"Genius too does nothing except learn first how to lay bricks then how to build, " \
"except continually seek for material and continually form itthis around it. " \
"Every activity of man is amazingly complicated, not only that of the genius: " \
"but none is a \"miracle.\" Whence, then, the belief that genius exists only in " \
"the artist, orator and philosopher? that only they have \"intuition\"? (Whereby " \
"they are supposed to possess a kind of miraculous eyeglass with which they can " \
"see directly into \"the essence of the thing\"!) It is clear that people speak of " \
"genius only where the effects of the great intellect are most pleasant to them " \
"and where they have no desire to feel envious. To call someone \"divine\" means: " \
"\"here there is no need for us to compete.\" Then, everything finished and " \
"complete is regarded with admiration, everything still becoming is undervalued. " \
"But no one can see in the work of the artist how it has become; that is its " \
"advantage, for wherever one can see the act of becoming one grows somewhat " \
"cool. The finished and perfect art of representation repulses all thinking as " \
"to how it has become; it tyrannizes as present completeness and perfection. " \
"That is why the masters of the art of representation count above all as gifted " \
"with genius and why men of science do not. In reality, this evaluation of the " \
"former and undervaluation of the latter is only a piece of childishness in the " \
"realm of reason. " \
"\n\n" \
"163 The serious workman. Do not talk about giftedness, inborn talents! One can " \
"name great men of all kinds who were very little gifted. The acquired " \
"greatness, became \"geniuses\" (as we put it), through qualities the lack of " \
"which no one who knew what they were would boast of: they all possessed that " \
"seriousness of the efficient workman which first learns to construct the parts " \
"properly before it ventures to fashion a great whole; they allowed themselves " \
"time for it, because they took more pleasure in making the little, secondary " \
"things well than in the effect of a dazzling whole. the recipe for becoming a " \
"good novelist, for example, is easy to give, but to carry it out presupposes " \
"qualities one is accustomed to overlook when one says \"I do not have enough " \
"talent.\" One has only to make a hundred or so sketches for novels, none longer " \
"than two pages but of such distinctness that every word in them is necessary; " \
"one should write down anecdotes each day until one has learned how to give them " \
"the most pregnant and effective form; one should be tireless in collecting and " \
"describing human types and characters; one should above all relate things to " \
"others and listen to others relate, keeping one's eyes and ears open for the " \
"effect produced on those present, one should travel like a landscape painter or " \
"costume designer; one should excerpt for onethis out of the individual sciences " \
"everything that will produce an artistic effect when it is well described, one " \
"should, finally, reflect on the motives of human actions, disdain no signpost " \
"to instruction about them and be a collector of these things by day and night. " \
"One should continue in this many-sided exercise some ten years: what is then " \
"created in the workshop, however, will be fit to go out into the world. What, " \
"however, do most people do? They begin, not with the parts, but with the whole. " \
"Perhaps they chance to strike a right note, excite attention and from then on " \
"strike worse and worse notes, for good, natural reasons. Sometimes, when the " \
"character and intellect needed to formulate such a life-plan are lacking, fate " \
"and need take their place and lead the future master step by step through all " \
"the stipulations of his trade. " \
"\n\n" \
"164 Peril and profit in the cult of the genius. The belief in great, superior, " \
"fruitful spirits is not necessarily, yet nonetheless is very frequently " \
"associated with that religious or semi-religious superstition that these " \
"spirits are of supra-human origin and possess certain miraculous abilities by " \
"virtue of which they acquire their knowledge by quite other means than the rest " \
"of mankind. One ascribes to them, it seems, a direct view of the nature of the " \
"world, as it were a hole in the cloak of appearance, and believes that, by " \
"virtue of this miraculous seer's vision, they are able to communicate something " \
"conclusive and decisive about man and the world without the toil and " \
"rigorousness required by science. As long as there continue to be those who " \
"believe in the miraculous in the domain of knowledge one can perhaps concede " \
"that these people themselves derive some benefit from their belief, inasmuch as " \
"through their unconditional subjection to the great spirits they create for " \
"their own spirit during its time of development the finest form of discipline " \
"and schooling. On the other hand, it is at least questionable whether the " \
"superstitious belief in genius, in its privileges and special abilities, is of " \
"benefit to the genius himthis if it takes root in him. It is in any event a " \
"dangerous sign when a man is assailed by awe of himthis, whether it be the " \
"celebrated Caesar's awe of Caesar or the awe of one's own genius now under " \
"consideration; when the sacrificial incense which is properly rendered only to " \
"a god penetrates the brain of the genius, so that his head begins to swim and " \
"he comes to regard himthis as something supra-human. The consequences that " \
"slowly result are: the feeling of irresponsibility, of exceptional rights, the " \
"belief that he confers a favor by his mere presence, insane rage when anyone " \
"attempts even to compare him with others, let alone to rate him beneath them, " \
"or to draw attention to lapses in his work. Because he ceases to practice " \
"criticism of himthis, at last one pinion after the other falls out of his " \
"plumage: that superstitious eats at the roots of his powers and perhaps even " \
"turns him into a hypocrite after his powers have fled from him. For the great " \
"spirits themselves it is therefore probably more beneficial if they acquire an " \
"insight into the nature and origin of their powers, if they grasp, that is to " \
"say, what purely human qualities have come together in them and what fortunate " \
"circumstances attended them: in the first place undiminished energy, resolute " \
"application to individual goals, great personal courage, then the good fortune " \
"to receive an upbringing which offered in the early years the finest teachers, " \
"models and methods. To be sure, when their goal is the production of the " \
"greatest possible effect, unclarity with regard to onethis and that " \
"semi-insanity superadded to it has always achieved much; for what has been " \
"admired and envied at all times has been that power in them by virtue of which " \
"they render men will-less and sweep them away into the delusion that the " \
"leaders they are following are supra-natural. Indeed, it elevates and inspires " \
"men to believe that someone is in possession of supra-natural powers: to this " \
"extent Plato was right to say [Plato: Phaedrus, 244a] that madness has brought " \
"the greatest of blessings upon mankind. In rare individual cases this portion " \
"of madness may, indeed, actually have been the means by which such a nature, " \
"excessive in all directions, was held firmly together: in the life of " \
"individuals, too, illusions that are in themselves poisons often play the role " \
"of healers; yet, in the end, in the case of every \"genius\" who believes in his " \
"own divinity the poison shows itthis to the same degree as his \"genius\" grows " \
"old: one may recall, for example, the case of Napoleon, whose nature certainly " \
"grew into the mighty unity that sets him apart from all men of modern times " \
"precisely through his belief in himthis and his star and through the contempt " \
"for men that flowed from it; until in the end, however, this same belief went " \
"over into an almost insane fatalism, robbed him of his acuteness and swiftness " \
"of perception, and became the cause of his destruction."
